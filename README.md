Welcome to my Python practice repository! This project is part of my personal journey to become a **Data Analyst**. I'm currently learning Python by manually typing code into **Spyder IDE** and reinforcing concepts through hands-on practice.
## ðŸ“˜ Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice foundational Python programming skills
- Build muscle memory by manually typing every line of code
- Document my learning journey toward becoming a data analyst
- Showcase my progress through organized practice and projects
